# Word Fuzzer - shuffles the middle letters of words

For example:

```
$ word-fuzzer what a wonderful day to be rusting away
waht a wornduefl day to be rntisug aawy
```

## But ... why?

The product of a boring Saturday morning. Gave me an excuse to write some Rust
code and get a feel for string manipulation using slices and so on.
